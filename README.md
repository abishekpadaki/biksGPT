# BiksGPT
Welcome to BiksGPT. This is a simple repo demonstrating how I build a simple Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), from first principles.

This was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT and makemore series.

I shall update and tweak this model as a way to experiment with stuff on my own. Apologies in advance if you find something broken. :)
